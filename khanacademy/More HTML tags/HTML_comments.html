            <p>
                Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Sauté veggies and garlic</strong></li> 
            <p>
                Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Stir fry rice</strong></li> 
            <p>
                Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.
                Remove pan from heat. And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.
                Taste and season. Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.
                Serve! Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!

            Once your skillet is nice and hot, add some oil and a 1/2-inch thick strip steak: 2 minutes on the first side, 1 minute on the second side (or even less, if you prefer a rarer steak like I do). Plate the steak.

Start with the dough. Add 900 grams of flour to the bowl, mix it with 1 teaspoon of salt. Then slowly start adding 450-460 mL of water. Once the dough forms into one uniform piece, take it out of the bowl and knead it for at least 15 to 20 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. After that, cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. 

Take the beef and either mince it yourself into tiny pieces or just use ground beef. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 300 grams of minced onion, 1 tablespoons of cilantro and 2 tablespoons of parley. Then slowly add about 1 cup of water and mix everything until the filling is uniform. The beef should be able to absorb some of the water. 

 After the dough is rested, take it and cut it into two equal halves and roll each piece into a log. Then take each log and cut it into 10 equal balls. You should now have 20 pieces that will make 20 Chebureki. 

Take each ball and press your palm on it, making it into a flat disk. Then take the rolling pin and roll it out into a circle with about 2 mm thickness. The diameter of the circle should be about 20 cm (8 inches).

Then take 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of meat filling and place it on the dough, spreading it evenly into a thin layer. Then close the Cheburek into a half moon shape, pressing on the edges, making sure that there would be no leaks. Then if you have pastry cutter, roll it across the edges. Or you can use a fork and press it across the edges. Now your first Cheburek is ready. Repeat until all of your Chebureki are prepared. 

Heat up the oil in the frying pan until it reaches about 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius). Once your oil is ready, carefully drop in your first Cheburek and start deep frying it. Right after the bottom part of the Cheburek turns golden, it is time to flip it and fry it again until the other side turns golden too.  The entire process should take about 1 to 2 minutes.  If your pan is big enough to fit 2 Chebureki, feel free to fry 2 of the at the same time. 

Remove your Chebureki and place them on paper towel to absorb excess oil. Repeat the frying process until all Chebureki are fried. 

Let each Cheburek rest for few minutes, you don’t want to burn your mouth! Then eat while still hot and fresh. Enjoy!
