    <!-- This template can be broken down into 3 parts:

DOCTYPE: Describes the type of HTML. While there are technically different types, for 99.999% of the HTML you'll write, youâ€™ll likely be fine with <!DOCTYPE html>.
<head>: Describes meta information about the site, such as the title, and provides links to scripts and stylesheets the site needs to render and behave correctly.
<body>: Describes the actual content of the site that users will see. -->
